<p><a name="desc"></a>DESCRIPTION</p>

<p>PHP guestbook where you visitors can post comments about your website.</p>

<hr>

<p>Requirements</p>

<ul>
        <li>UNIX or Windows server (it *might* work on others too)</li>
        <li>PHP4 support</li>
        <li>FTP access and a FTP program</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<p><a name="upgrade"></a><b>&gt;&gt; Upgrade from version 1.33</b></p>

<p>To upgrade from version 1.33 to version 1.34 follow these steps:</p>

<ol>
<li>BACKUP your old Gbook</li>
<li>Edit the new settings.php file (more info under &quot;Installation&quot;)
as a new variable has been added</li>
<li>Upload these files to your server (all in ASCII mode): gbook.php, settings.php</li>
<li>Test everything. All your current posts should stay intact.</li>
</ol>

<hr>

<p><a name="install"></a><b>&gt;&gt; Installation</b></p>

<p>Open file settings.php in your favorite <b>PLAIN TEXT</b> editor (like Notepad or
Wordpad on Windows systems, DO NOT use MS Word or similar editor) and set these variables:</p>

<ul>
<li><b>$settings['system']</b> - set to 1 if your website is on a server under Linux (most servers are),
set to 2 if it is under Windows (your SERVER, not your computer!). If you are not
sure which operating system your server runs under
try with $settings['system'] set to 1 first or consult your web hosting company.
If you are under some other OS (not Linux nor Win)
you can try setting it from 1 to 3 and see if it works<br><br></li>
<li><b>$settings['apass']</b> - this will be your password for the admin panel. Change it from the
default password <b>admin</b>. Use only letters a-Z, A-Z and numbers 0-9<br><br></li>
<li><b>$settings['website_title']</b> - A short title of your website, eg &quot;My lovely website&quot;<br><br></li>
<li><b>$settings['website_url']</b> - URL of your website. This is the URL your link
partners will have to place on their website.<br><br></li>
<li><b>$settings['gbook_title']</b> - Title of your guestbook, eg &quot;My guestbook&quot;<br><br></li>
<li><b>$settings['smileys']</b> - If set to <b>1</b> text like :), ;) etc will be replaced by smileys (image icons).
Individual visitors will still be able to disable smileys for their entry. If you don't
want to allow smileys set to <b>0</b>.<br><br></li>
<li><b>$settings['notify']</b> - If set to <b>1</b> you will receive an e-mail notification
at your admin e-mail address every time a new entry is added to your guestbook. Set
to <b>0</b> if you don't want to be notified.<br><br></li>
<li><b>$settings['admin_email']</b> - Your e-mail address where new entry notifications
will be sent. Only required if $settings['notify'] is set to 1.<br><br></li>
<li><b>$settings['gbook_url']</b> - URL of the <b>gbook.php</b> script. For example
http://www.yourdomain.com/guestbook/gbook.php<br><br></li>
<li><b>$settings['filter']</b> - If set to <b>1</b> all new posts will be filtered for bad words and replaced
by ****. Set to <b>0</b> if you don't want to be notified.<br><br></li>
<li><b>$settings['filter_lang']</b> - The language of bad words file. For now only English language is supported
so you can only use "en" (CaSe SeNSiTiVe). Please read section &quot;Adding / Translating bad words list&quot; further down for
info on how to add/translate bad words.<br><br></li>
<li><b>$settings['autosubmit']</b> - Setting this to 1(recommended) will require entering a &quot;security number&quot; in order to successfully
submit a new entry to the guestbook. I have added this to prevent SPAMing the guestbook. Set to 0 if you want to disable the security number check.<br><br></li>
<li><font color="#FF0000">NEW:</font> <b>$settings['filter_sum']</b> - this variable is used in the preventing automated
submissions and is just a little trick that should make it all even more reliable. The idea is to set this
to some random sequence of chars and numbers, for example <b>dhjx72js</b>. It doesn't really matter how long it is,
but you should use only chars (a-zA-Z) and digits (0-9). Don't leave the default value
(as it would loose the whole point), set it to something of your own. Examples would be
g3oyf98, p9ak85i, h398dgf and similar. Again, DO NOT USE these examples, just type some chars of your own!<br><br></li>
<li><b>$settings['one_per_session']</b> - if set to 1 each person will be able to make
only one post per browser session. As of version 1.33 you can officially disable this by setting this
variable to 0<br><br></li>
<li><b>$settings['max_word']</b> - The maximum length of each line of comments.
This is to prevent long &quot;words&quot; like ffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff
from stretching your guestbook.<br><br></li>
<li><b>$settings['logfile']</b> - File where all the data (entries) will be stored
(advanced users only).
You may leave this as it is.<br><br></li>
</ul>

<p>Save and close the settings.php file.</p>

<p>Go to your FTP client and FTP to the public
directory on your server (where the rest
of your website is; usually &quot;public_html&quot;, &quot;www&quot; or &quot;site&quot;)
and create
a folder where you will install GBook.<br>
Example: /public_html/gbook<br>
Corresponding URL: http://www.yourdomain.com/gbook</p>

<p>Upload all GBook files to this folder. The &quot;images&quot; folder (all files in this folder)
must be transferred in BINARY mode, other files in ASCII mode (refer to your FTP client
instructions for details on how to set transfer mode properly).</p>

<p>Make sure that the PHP scripts have permission to write to file entries.txt
- on UNIX (Linux) servers you must CHMOD (set permissions for) this
file to 666 (rw-rw-rw).</p>

<p>If you have done all this your guestbook should work now. In your browser open
your GBook, for example:<br>
http://www.yourdomain.com/gbook/gbook.php and test it. You can delete messages
by clicking the red [X] icon and entering your admin password.</p>

<p>You may edit header.txt and footer.txt files to add your own header and footer
to the links page. You will have to use <b>full image URLs</b> in the code. For example
instead of &lt;IMG SRC=&quot;images/image.jpg&quot; ... &gt; use
&lt;IMG SRC=&quot;http://www.yourdomain.com/images/image.jpg&quot; ... &gt;! Same
goes for any Javascripts or CSS files if you are calling them from within the
header or footer.</p>

<p>Good luck with the script!</p>

<hr>

<p><a name="translate"></a><b>&gt;&gt; Adding / Translating bad words list</b></p>

<p>As of version 1.2 GBook can search for bad words in the comments and replace them
with ****. Files with bad words list are stored in folder &quot;badwords&quot; and have two
letter names. For now only English version is available (named &quot;en.php&quot;).</p>

<p><b>Before adding new words please install GBook and test it so you are sure it works properly!</b></p>

<p>To add new bad words open the en.php file in your favorite <b>PLAIN TEXT</b> editor (like Notepad or
Wordpad on Windows systems, DO NOT use MS Word or similar editor), find the comment saying
INSERT NEW BAD WORDS BELOW THIS LINE and add new bad words in this format:<br><br>
&quot;BADWORD&quot; => &quot;REPLACEMENT&quot;,<br><br>
For example if &quot;asfhkjhfasf&quot; is a bad word you would add this line to the file:<br><br>
&quot;asfhkjhfasf&quot; => &quot;a**********&quot;,<br><br>
Don't forget to add a comma ( , ) after the line!</p>

<p>If you are translating the bad words file I suggest you leave the English words and add new ones in your language as explained
above. Then save the file as two letter country code php file. For example, if you are translating the file in French, you
should save the file as <b>fr.php</b> (CaSe SeNSiTiVe!). Upload fr.php to your &quot;badwords&quot; folder,
go to settings.php again and set <b>$settings['filter_lang']</b> to <b>&quot;fr&quot;</b> (file name without .php).</p>

<p>Now test the GBook again. If you get an Error or Warning when you try to post a new message this means
something is wrong with your language file. It either can't be found (check the name of the file, on most servers
names are CaSe SeNsiTiVe!) or something is wrong with PHP syntax in it (make sure all the words are added in<br>
<b>&quot;BADWORD&quot; => &quot;REPLACEMENT&quot;,</b> syntax).</p>

<p><b>Please send me the translated file</b>. If you translate the bad words file to your language please send it
to info AT phpjunkyard DOT com (or contact me through PHPJunkard.com contact form) and I will make it available
to others for download. You may include your name, website URL and e-mail address and I will give you proper credit
(translated by John Doe. Visit www.yourwebsite.com).</p>

<hr>

<p><a name="copy"></a><b>&gt;&gt; Troubleshooting</b></p>

<p><b>What is CHMOD and FTP?</b></p>

<p>I have prepared a simple <a href="http://www.phpjunkyard.com/ftp-chmod-tutorial.php" target="_blank">
FTP and CHMOD tutorial</a> which will help you FTP files to your server and
set correct CHMOD settings.</p>

<p><b>My guestbook doesn't work, HELP!</b></p>

<p>Here are a few things to check:</p>
<ol>
<li>did you upload the images folder in BINARY mode and all other files ASCII mode?</li>
<li>is entries.txt file world writable? CHMOD it to 666 (rw-rw-rw) if you are on a UNIX server</li>
<li>if images don't display correctly check if you uploaded them (the entire &quot;images&quot;
folder) correctly. The images folder must be place within the guestbook folder, for example
http://www.yourdomain.com/guestbook/images</li>
<li>go through the entire setup process again carefully</li>
</ol>

<p>Since these scripts are free no support is guaranteed. If you can't get the script to work please go
through this readme file again carefully and repeat the installation step-by-step (also delete old
files and folders from the server). Also please feel free to post any questions or problems you might have
in <a href="http://developers.phpjunkyard.com">PHPJunkyard forum</a>!</p>
